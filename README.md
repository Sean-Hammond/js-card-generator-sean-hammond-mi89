Start coding a JS/HTML/CSS website in 30 seconds by opening this template using 4Geeks' [One-Click Coding](https://s.4geeks.com/start?repo=https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/vanillajs-hello) or locally on your computer.

## If you want to fork your own version of this:

### Before you begin

Install the packages by typing: `npm install`.

#### How do I run my website to see live changes?  

Type on the command line `$ npm run start` and type localhost on the browser.

### Troubleshooting

#### I don't see my changes...

Everytime you change any file inside the `./src` folder the website's public URL will automatically refresh the changes (it's a process called hot deploy)
Remember also to refresh cleaning the cache (`command+shift+r` on Mac, `control+shift+r` on PC & Linux)

#### How do I include more JS files?

Just add the files into the src folder and import the file/variables into your app.js. E.g: `import myVar from "./file2.js"`

#### How do I publish the website?

We have prepared the boilerplate to be compatible with [vercel](https://vercel.com/), very easy and in just one step! 
You can read more about [deploying on vercel here](https://4geeks.com/docs/start/deploy-vercel).
